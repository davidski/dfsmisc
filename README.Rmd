**dfsmisc** provides some basic RStudio addins for my personal use.

- Theme switching 

## Installation

GitHub only.

``` r
devtools::install_github("davidski/dfsmisc")
```

## What's Included?

Two addins

* Set Light Theme: Useful for switching quicking when presenting or screen sharing. `r emo::ji("microphone")`
* Set Dark Theme: Useful for when not doing either of the above. `r emo::ji("wink")`
