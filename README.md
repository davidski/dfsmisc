**dfsmisc** provides some basic RStudio addins for my personal use.

Inspired by Hao Zhuâ€™s RStudio::conf 2019
[talk](https://haozhu233.github.io/rstudioconf2019_addin_talk/#1).

  - Theme switching

## Installation

GitHub only.

``` r
devtools::install_github("davidski/dfsmisc")
```

## Whatâ€™s Included?

Two addins

  - Set Light Theme: Useful for switching quicking when presenting or
    screen sharing. ðŸŽ¤
  - Set Dark Theme: Useful for when not doing either of the above. ðŸ˜‰
